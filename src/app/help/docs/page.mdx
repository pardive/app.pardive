# Documentation

> This page explains the docs version, last updated date, and how to navigate and use the left panel.

## Meta

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| **Documentation Version** | **v0.1.0** |
| **Last Updated** | **2025-09-11** |
| **Scope** | Saltify Help → Documentation |

## How to use these docs

- Use the **Help** bar at the top to switch between sections like _Documentation_, _My Cases_, _Blogs_, _Use Cases_.
- The main content appears on the **right**; follow headings and links within each page.
- The search box in the Help bar lets you **find topics quickly** by keyword.

## Using the left panel (sidebar)

- The left panel is **sticky** and stays in view as you scroll.
- Click a section to **expand** its topics; the current page’s link will be highlighted.
- Links like “Quick Start”, “Workspace”, and “Next Steps” jump to headings on the page.
- On very narrow screens, scroll slightly to ensure the panel is visible under the Help bar.

## Tips

- If a link doesn’t open, you may be on `/help/doc` — the correct path is **`/help/docs`**.
- Refresh the page after major updates to ensure the latest content and navigation are loaded.
