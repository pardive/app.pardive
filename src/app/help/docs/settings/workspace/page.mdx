# Workspace

Workspace settings control the “container” your team works in: where data lives, how it’s formatted, which domain it uses, and who can access it.

## Sections
- [Regions](/help/docs/settings/workspace/regions) – data residency
- [Default Locale](/help/docs/settings/workspace/locale) – language & formats
- [Primary Domain](/help/docs/settings/workspace/domains) – canonical domain
- [Members](/help/docs/settings/workspace/members) – people & permissions
