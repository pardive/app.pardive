## Getting started checklist

1. **Create your workspace** → set name, region, locale, and primary domain.
2. **Invite your team** → assign roles (Owner, Admin, Member).
3. **Brand your account** → upload logo, set colors & typography.
4. **Connect data** → create your first Data Table (contacts, companies, etc.).
5. **Build a page or form** → publish to a test subdomain.
6. **Set up automations** → send webhooks or sync to external apps.
7. **Review billing** → choose a plan, add payment method.

> **Tip:** Keep staging and production separate. Use a staging subdomain for internal testing.

## Workspace & Settings

### Regions
Choose where core resources live (US/EU). Region affects data residency and latency.

**Change region**
1. Go to **Settings → Workspace → Regions**  
2. Select **United States** or **European Union**  
3. Review the migration summary → **Confirm**

> **Note:** Region changes can trigger brief maintenance windows.

### Default Locale
Controls date formats, number formats, and default language labels.

### Primary Domain
The canonical root domain used to compose product sub-domains.

### Members & Roles
- **Owner:** billing + all permissions  
- **Admin:** manage users, settings, content  
- **Member:** create & edit content within assigned modules

---

## Branding

Upload your **logo**, pick **colors**, and set **font** preferences. Branded assets appear in headers, footers, and public pages.

**Recommended sizes**
- Logo (SVG preferred), 24–48px height for nav
- Favicon 32×32, 48×48
- Social/OG image 1200×630

---

## Build your first page / form

1. Go to **Create → Page** (or **Form**)  
2. Pick a template or start blank  
3. Configure **layout grid** and **sections**  
4. Drag components: **Text, Image, Video, HTML/JS**  
5. Connect to a **Data Table** (for submissions)  
6. **Preview**, then **Publish** to `your-subdomain.example.com`

> **Troubleshooting publish:** If DNS isn’t ready, publishing may show a temporary preview URL.

---

## Data & Automations

### Data Tables
Structured storage for submissions and records.

- **Attributes/Fields:** text, email, phone, select, date, number
- **Unique keys:** email, mobile, external ID

### Automations
Trigger actions on events (submit, create, update).

- **Actions:** Webhook (REST), Upsert, Delete, Notify
- **Retries:** exponential backoff (up to 3 attempts)
- **Logs:** view success/failure per run

---

## Billing & Plans

- **Free/Trial:** limited records & automation runs
- **Pro:** custom domains, higher limits, priority support
- **Enterprise:** SSO, data residency options, SLA

> Update payment method at **Settings → Billing**. Invoices are available as PDFs.

---

## Security

- Role-based access control (RBAC)  
- Audit trails for settings and publishing  
- SSO/SAML (Enterprise)

---

## Troubleshooting

- **I can’t see the sidebar.**  
  Ensure your viewport width ≥ 1024px or open the sidebar from the top-left menu.

- **Publishing failed.**  
  Check DNS status for the target domain; re-publish after propagation.

- **Form submissions missing.**  
  Confirm the form is connected to the intended Data Table and fields are mapped.

- **Automation not firing.**  
  Verify the trigger event and inspect the run log for error codes.

## FAQ

**Can I move workspaces between regions?**  
Yes—use **Settings → Workspace → Regions**. Expect a short maintenance window.

**Do you support custom domains?**  
Yes on Pro+. Add a domain, verify DNS (CNAME), then publish.

**Where can I export my data?**  
From the Data Table: **More → Export CSV**. API access is available on Pro+.
